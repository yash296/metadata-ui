    Project Overview
    In this assignment, you will design a metadata-driven UI using Vue.
    The primary objective is to create a demo app that displays UI based on the data provided by an external source.
    External source decides what components to display and what data to put in those components.

    Assume that external sources correctly follow your guidance on how to deliver data. For this assignment, prepare a
    JSON file(s) with example data and simulate loading that data (imitate HTTP call) to showcase your solution. Please
    showcase your solution with at least two examples of input data that display multiple components in each case.

    Note: You will be required to demonstrate your knowledge and skills live during the interview. You may also be
    required to make adjustments to your solution live. If you cannot demonstrate true understanding and skills live,
    the interview will be terminated.



    Tasks
    1. Input Structure

    Prepare input data structure that external sources will follow to define the view and its data.

    2. Dummy Components

    Prepare a few simple components to display example data, e.g. heading, image, button. You decide what data is
    accepted by a given component.

    3. Metadata Processor

    Design a central component/function that will process the input and build a view based on that.

    4. Support data flow

    Make sure that the data can still be passed/shared between components; Please include at least one example of that
    in your demo.

    5. What Could Go Wrong

    Discuss risks and WCGW scenarios for the metadata-driven UIs.



    Deliverables
    Demo app
    Vue 3 application that achieves objectives described above. You can use any library and framework you see fit.
    Metadata Handling Strategy
    Provide a comprehensive description of your solution including what could go wrong scenarios.
    Evaluation Criteria
    Design Quality: Suitability and extendibility of the proposed solution.
    Innovation and Approach: Creativity in solution and understanding of metadata-driven design.
    Best Practices: Adherence to Vue.js best practices in event handling and component communication.
    Documentation: Clarity, detail, and usefulness of the documentation in explaining and supporting your design.
    Submission
    Provide a 5 minute video showcasing how your solution addresses tasks listed in the assignment. You can use screen
    recording videos either as attachments or as links using a video recording cloud tool like https://www.loom.com
    Please submit the app through a GIT repository link

    Notes for Candidates
    Time Management: The assignment is designed to take 3 - 6 hours. Please prioritize the most critical aspects of the
    design to fit within this timeframe.
    Focus on end to end demo: Your demo app should showcase your design.
    Suitability and extendibility: Consider extending the application with new components in the future. Make sure your
    solution is abstract enough to support growth while still providing a solid foundation for app development.
    Innovation: We value creative solutions that enhance usability and user experience.
